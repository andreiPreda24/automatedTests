QA Automation Practice
This repository contains two basic Java classes that demonstrate introductory concepts in test automation. These scripts are intended for learning purposes and will be updated as I progress through my QA Automation journey.

Project Structure
Located in src/main/java:

E2E.java
Automates a simple end-to-end test on a mock flight booking website.

base.java
Automates a basic scenario on a mock e-commerce site â€” it adds items to the cart (currently hardcoded to accept new items if they should be implemented in the future).

Scope
The scripts focus on foundational test automation workflows using Java. As learning progresses, the code will be refactored, expanded, and optimized to include:

More dynamic input handling

Improved test structure and organization

Integration with testing frameworks (e.g., TestNG, JUnit)

Better error handling and reporting
